            <p>My interest for tech started <span class="highlight-text">from a young age</span> when I successfully installed a Pink Panther game as a
                boy despite my father's failure at it. Since then, I have loved playing and tinkering with software,
                whether it would be smaller scripts or modifying games. <span class="highlight-text">In the summer of 2023</span> I finally made the
                jump from being a financial analyst to pursue a lifelong dream/challenge as a software developer.
            </p>
            <p>Whether it would be <span class="highlight-text">scripting or using cheat engine</span> to bend the games towards my will, or hosting
                Minecraft servers for me and my friends and others to join by adventurously opening the ports of my
                home network, the computer has been a large part of my life. However, my first real step into coding
                would first start after I completed a <span class="highlight-text">B.A in Accounting and Finance</span> and worked in that industry for a
                couple of years. That experience pushed me into finally taking my hobby as a serious career. It all
                started with a <span class="highlight-text">Java Bootcamp</span> which did not go as I expected, which led me to pursue courses online,
                start a interest in game development and finally start attending <span class="highlight-text">Chas Academy as a System Developer
                    using C/C++.</span></p>
